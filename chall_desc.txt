Oh no! The evil terrorist group Apocalypse have stolen a precious and very dangerous artifact from a raid on a secret government base, and is now using the malicious ransomware to encrypt all files!
The ransomware seems to use some very state of the art geolocation cryptography at particular points in time to encrypt the data...can you find a way to stop it and reverse its nefarious encryption?

Attached is a database that was uncovered by our secret agent within Apocalypse which had been used to encrypt the data...can you make sense of it?
